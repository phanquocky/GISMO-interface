#          Set the name of the job (up to 15 characters,
#          no blank spaces, start with alphanumeric character)

#PBS -N ic-encoding

#          By default, the standard output and error streams are sent
#          to files in the current working directory with names:
#              job_name.osequence_number  <-  output stream
#              job_name.esequence_number  <-  error stream
#          where job_name is the name of the job and sequence_number
#          is the job number assigned when the job is submitted.
#          Use the directives below to change the files to which the
#          standard output and error streams are sent.

#    #PBS -o stdout_file
#    #PBS -e stderr_file

#          The directive below directs that the standard output and
#          error streams are to be merged, intermixed, as standard
#          output.

#PBS -j oe

#          Specify the maximum cpu and wall clock time. The wall
#          clock time should take possible queue waiting time into
#          account.  Format:   hhhh:mm:ss   hours:minutes:seconds
#          Be sure to specify a reasonable value here.
#          If the job does not finish by the time reached,
#          the job is terminated.

#PBS -l     walltime=12:30:00
########PBS -l     walltime=1:30:00
########PBS -l walltime=00:15:00

#          Specify the queue.  The CMU cluster currently has three queues:
#          "green", "blue", and "red".  Jobs submitted to these queues
#          will run in cpu-dedicated mode; if all cpu's assigned to the
#          queue are occupied with a job, then new jobs are queued and will
#          not run until a cpu is freed up.  You should take this waiting
#          time into account when setting "walltime".

#PBS -q normal

#          Specify the maximum amount of physical memory required.
#          kb for kilobytes, mb for megabytes, gb for gigabytes.
#          Take some care in setting this value.  Setting it too large
#          can result in your job waiting in the queue for sufficient
#          resources to become available.

#      #PBS -l mem=2gb

#          PBS can send informative email messages to you about the
#          status of your job.  Specify a string which consists of
#          either the single character "n" (no mail), or one or more
#          of the characters "a" (send mail when job is aborted),
#          "b" (send mail when job begins), and "e" (send mail when
#          job terminates).  The default is "a" if not specified.
#          You should also specify the email address to which the
#          message should be send via the -M option.

#PBS -m abe
#   #PBS -m ae

#PBS -M latour@nus.edu.sg

#          Declare the time after which the job is eligible for execution.
#          If you wish the job to be immediately eligible for execution,
#          comment out this directive.  If you wish to run at some time in
#          future, the date-time argument format is
#                      [DD]hhmm
#          If the day DD is not specified, it will default to today if the
#          time hhmm is in the future, otherwise, it defaults to tomorrow.
#          If the day DD is specified as in the future, it defaults to the
#          current month, otherwise, it defaults to next month.

# #PBS -a 2215  commented out

#          Specify the priority for the job.  The priority argument must be
#          an integer between -1024 and +1023 inclusive.  The default is 0.

#  #PBS -p 0

#          Specify the number of nodes requested and the
#          number of processors per node.

########PBS -l select=1:ncpus=2:mpiprocs=2:mem=8G
#PBS -l select=2:ncpus=24:mpiprocs=24:mem=96G
########PBS -l select=1:ncpus=24:mpiprocs=24:mem=96G

#          Define the interval at which the job will be checkpointed,
#          if checkpointing is desired, in terms of an integer number
#          of minutes of CPU time.
